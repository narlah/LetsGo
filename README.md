# LetsGo
I really wanted to try static linking language. So far i had VM (java) and python (scripting).
Then i fell in love in linux and started learning c. 
That proved fruitful at the time, but it is kind of verbose compared to java (let alone python).
Checked Go and really loved the type infering, the speed, the intuitive nature of the keywords and the simplicity of the structures.
So here we are :)
